<p>See the overview below for a description of the ActiveBPEL&trade; engine's
architecture. The ActiveBPEL engine executes Business Process Execution
Language (BPEL) processes. It accepts BPEL process definitions, creates
process instances, and executes them. </p>

<p>There are three main areas in the architecture of the ActiveBPEL engine:
the <em><a href="#engine">engine</a></em>, <em><a
href="#processes">processes</a></em>, and <em><a
href="#activities">activities</a></em>. The ActiveBPEL engine coordinates the
execution of one or more BPEL processes. Processes are in turn made up of
activities, which may in turn contain or link to further activities. The
ActiveBPEL engine creates a process from a BPEL process definition (an XML
file) and then executes this process. (Processes may also be
<em>abstract</em>, which means they are non-executable, but the ActiveBPEL
engine runs executable processes.) This architecture document describes these
three main areas&mdash;the engine, processes, and
activities<small>.</small></p>

<p>The &quot;database&quot; elements on the right of this illustration
represent generic persistent storage. The ActiveBPEL engine uses a pluggable
architecture; different persistence managers may implement different storage
mechanisms. The ActiveBPEL engine ships with a persistence manager that keeps
everything in memory.</p>

<h3>Engine Startup</h3>

<p>An engine factory manages 
  the creation of an ActiveBPEL engine. Separation of responsibilities 
  is achieved through the use of objects that handle services such 
  as queue management, alarm and timer services, and process deployment. 
  The following pseudocode describes the factory's creation of the 
  engine and supporting services.</p>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 0;">
engine = new Engine(getEngineConfigurationInfo(),
                    createQueueManager(),
                    createProcessStateManager());
engine.setPlanManager(createProcessDeploymentProvider());
createProcessDeploymentManager();
createWorkManager();
createAlarmAndTimerService();</pre>

<p>Engine configuration is handled by an object that supplies default values
  and reads the optional <code>aeEngineConfig.xml</code> file. The engine is
  connected to a queue manager and a process state manager, objects that are
  responsible for performing those services for the engine. </p>

<p>A process deployment provider handles reading Process Deployment Descriptor
  (.pdd) files, and a process deployment manager handles process creation (see
  <em><a href="#processcreation">Process Creation</a></em> below).</p>

<p>A work manager schedules asynchronous operations.</p>

<h3><a name="processcreation"></a>Process Creation</h3>

<p>A new BPEL process gets created when one of its start activities is
  triggered, either by an incoming message or by a Pick activity's alarm. When
  an incoming message contains correlation data, the engine finds the existing
  process matching the data instead. See <em><a
  href="#dispatching">Dispatching Requests</a></em> for details. </p>

<p>When the engine reads a BPEL process definition it creates objects called
  <em>activity definitions</em> that model the process.</p>

<div class="figure">
  <img width="409" height="185" src="overview/images/clip_image001.jpg" alt="Runtime Engine Object Creation"/>
  <p>Figure 2. Runtime Engine Object Creation</p>
</div>

<p>Activity definitions contain all of the information required to instantiate
  a BPEL <em>activity implementation</em> object. In this regard, definitions
  are analogous to classes while the implementation objects are analogous to
  instances of those classes&mdash;objects.</p>

<p>Both the engine and its event listeners have access to these definitions.
  The events contain an XPath value that indicates which activity in the
  process is triggering the event. These XPath values come from the activity
  definitions.</p>

<p>The engine creates its implementation objects by using a Visitor pattern to
  visit the activity definition object model and creating implementation
  objects from this model. The ActiveBPEL engine encapsulates any
  implementation logic within this construction process. For example, an
  implicit scope within an invoke activity will generate an explicit scope
  with a single invoke child activity. The designer or other listeners don't
  have to know about these implementation decisions since they're only aware
  of the definitions and their XPath information.</p>

<h3>Input and Output</h3>

<p>The ActiveBPEL engine 
  itself does not handle input and output. Instead, protocol-specific 
  handlers such as <code>AeBpelRPCHandler</code> and <code>AeBpelDocumentHandler</code> 
  translate data from a particular protocol to a message and vice 
  versa.</p>

<h3>Data Handling</h3>

<p>All variables implement the <code>IAeVariable</code> interface. This
  interface has the ability to get the definition and the payload, which will
  be different if the variable is declared as a type versus an element or
  message. The message payload requires an interface for detailed interactions
  with the part objects.</p>

<h3>Expression Evaluation</h3>

<p>All activities and links allow expressions for various attributes of the
  object. These expressions require a consistent method for execution and
  describing the execution context. The <code>IAeBpelObject</code> itself can
  wrapper execution and can be supplied in the abstract base class from which
  the objects inherit. The BPEL object is itself a scope (in the variable
  sense of the word) and can be used to correctly retrieve the accessible
  variables of the expression context. Evaluation allows all the XPath
  extensions which have been documented in the BPEL spec (for example,
  <code>bpws:getVariableData</code>).</p>

<h3 id="debuglog">Debugging and Logging</h3>

<p>During process execution, the ActiveBPEL engine fires events indicating its
  progress. When logging is turned on, an instance of
  <code>AEEngineLogger</code> listens for engine events and writes them out to
  individual process log files. Once the process completes, the file will be
  closed.</p>

<p>The log files are created in the directory
  <code><var>{user.home}</var>/AeBpelEngine/process-logs</code>, where
  <code><var>{user.home}</var></code> is the value of the Java System property
  &quot;user.home&quot;. The log files are named
  <code><var>process-id</var>.log</code>, where
  <code><var>process-id</var></code> is a process id number assigned by the
  engine. To turn on logging, add a <code>Logging</code> element to
  aeEngineConfig.xml. See <a
  href="http://www.activebpel.org/docs/file_formats.html">ActiveBPEL Engine
  Config File Formats</a> for details. </p>

<h2 id="processes">Processes</h2>

<p>A process consists of</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Partner links</dt>
  <dd>Describe a relationship between two Web services at the interface
    level</dd>
  <dt>Partners</dt>
  <dd>Entities taking part in a Web service transaction</dd>
  <dt>Variables</dt>
  <dd>Containers for values</dd>
  <dt>Correlation sets</dt>
  <dd>Sets of data that uniquely identify the business process. At
    different times in the process, different correlation sets may
    identify the process</dd>
  <dt>Fault handlers</dt>
  <dd>Describe what to do when problems occur</dd>
  <dt>Compensation handlers</dt>
  <dd>Describe how to reverse already-completed business processes</dd>
  <dt>Event handlers</dt>
  <dd>Handle incoming messages and alarms</dd>
  <dt>A top-level activity</dt>
  <dd>A single BPEL activity, usually a container for other activities</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="dispatching">Dispatching Requests</h3>

<p>Each BPEL process must have at least one <em>start activity</em>. A new
  BPEL process gets created when one of its start activities is triggered,
  either by an incoming message or by a Pick activity's alarm.</p>

<p>The engine dispatches incoming messages to the correct process instance. If
  there is correlation data, the engine tries to find the correct instance
  that matches the correlation data. If there is no correlation data and the
  request matches a start activity, a new process instance is created.</p>

<div class="figure">
  <img width="594" height="386" src="overview/images/clip_image002_0004.jpg" alt="Request Dispatch Flowchart"/>
  <p>Figure 3. Request Dispatch Flowchart</p>
</div>

<h4 id="queued-receives">Queued Receives</h4>

<p>The receive queue contains the currently executing receive activities
across all process instances. Receive activities include onMessage activities
that are part of a pick or an event handler. A receive activity is said to be
executing when it has been queued by its parent (for example, a scope, flow,
or sequence) but has not yet received the message that it's waiting for from
the outside world.</p>

<p>The receive queue also contains inbound messages from the outside world
that did not match up to a waiting receive activity already in the queue and
were themselves not capable of creating a new process instances. An unmatched
receipt of data like this is possible given the asynchronous nature of some
Web services. The engine will accept these unmatched messages provided that
they contain correlation data. These messages are queued until a timeout
period passes. The period is specified by the engine configuration parameter
<code>UnmatchedReceiveTimeout</code>.</p>

<p>If a process queues an activity like a receive, then this activity will
stay in there until the data arrives or the process terminates (through a
fault or terminate activity). Picks are slightly different: the first
onMessage or onAlarm to match for the pick immediately sets the state of all
of the other possible messages/alarms for that pick to <code>DEAD_PATH</code>.
This will remove them from the queue. Event handlers automatically remove
their queue entries once the scope that defines them completes.</p>

<h2 id="activities">Activities</h2>

<p>Activities are the building blocks of BPEL processes. <a
  href="#basic"><em>Basic activities</em></a> are conceptually simple
  behaviors like receiving a message, invoking a Web service, and assigning
  values to variables. <a href="#structured"><em>Structured
  activities</em></a> are similar to conditional and looping constructs in
  programming languages. <a href="#special"><em>Special activities</em></a>
  introduce variable scoping and handle abnormal activities such as process
  termination and compensation (explicitly &quot;undoing&quot; a process).</p>

<p>Activities are joined by links, either explicit or implicit. The path taken
  through the activities and links is determined by many factors, including
  the values of variables and the evaluation of expressions.</p>

<p>Every activity exists within a <em>scope</em> which is a context for
  variables, fault handlers, and compensation handlers. Scopes are
  conceptually similar to programming language blocks that introduce new
  variable scope and (depending upon the language and construct used)
  exception handling mechanisms. Some activities such as Scope and Invoke
  generate new scopes, whether implicitly or explicitly.</p>

<h3>States</h3>

<p>Each activity has an associated <em>state.</em> The activities enter or
  exit these states based on the rules of BPEL. The activities also fire
  events to notify listeners of their changes in state. There are mechanisms
  in place for listening to these events.</p>

<p>State constants are defined in <code>AeBpelState</code>. An activity must
  be in one of the following states:</p>

<table class="border-table">
  <tr>
    <th>State</th>
    <th>Notes</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>INACTIVE</code></td>

  <tr>
    <td><code>DEAD_PATH</code></td>
    <td>Removed from the execution path due to dead path elimination.
      When a parent activity's state becomes <code>DEAD_PATH</code>,
      that state is propagated to all of its children</td>
  </tr>

    <td>Queued for execution by their parents</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>TERMINATED</code></td>
    <td>Terminated</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Unknown</td>
    <td>The activity's state is <code>null</code>. If a parent activity's
      state becomes unknown, then the childrens' states change to <code>INACTIVE</code>.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>Activities</h3>

<p>All activities have a common set of methods that facilitate the movement
  between states and the above referenced event firing. This overview of these
  methods is followed by a detailed description of each activity's
  implementation.</p>

<h4>Activity class hierarchy</h4>

<div class="figure">
  <img width="590" height="400" src="overview/images/clip_image002_0005.jpg" alt="Activity Class Hierarchy"/>
  <p>Figure 4. Activity Class Hierarchy</p>
</div>

<p>Some activities such as the structured activities and Scope contain
  other activities.</p>

<h4>Common methods</h4>

<p>These are some of the methods common to all activities.</p>

<p><code>isReadyToExecute()</code></p>
<blockquote> Returns true if the Activity is OK to prepare for execution.
  This is determined by checking the activity's incoming links if
  any. Some activities use this method to perform some initialization.</blockquote>

<p><code>execute()</code></p>
<blockquote> This is where the activity's primary action takes place.
  The activity may set up any supporting elements required for the
  activity's execution. An example of this is a Scope activity creating
  variables. Then this method performs the primary action. For example,
  if it's an Invoke, this is where the invocation is made to the
  Web service. </blockquote>

<p><code>objectCompleted()</code></p>
<blockquote> Called by the activity when it is done with its execution.
  This method processes any outgoing links (aka source links) and
  then signals the process that the activity is complete.</blockquote>

<p><code>terminate()</code></p>
<blockquote> Called by a parent process when there is a fault and
  the activity is required to terminate. </blockquote>

<h3>Link handling and dead path elimination</h3>

<p>The BPEL 1.1 spec covers 
  link handling in Section 12.5. Below are some noteworthy points 
  from the spec:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Links cannot cross the boundary of a <code>&lt;while&gt;</code>,
    serializable <code>&lt;scope&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;eventHandlers&gt;</code>,
    or a <code>&lt;compensationHandler&gt;</code></li>
  <li>Links can only be OUTBOUND from within a Fault Handler</li>
  <li>Activities that have <code>suppressJoinFailure</code> set to true have
    an IMPLICIT Scope around them with the only behavior being a fault handler
    for <code>bpws:joinFailure</code>. In the event that the activity is an
    Invoke with an implicit Scope then the two Scopes are MERGED to form a
    single Scope with the same name as the activity.</li>
</ul>
