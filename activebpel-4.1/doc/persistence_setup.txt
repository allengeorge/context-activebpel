Requirements

    To setup the ActiveBPEL engine to run as a persistent engine you will need
    the following:
   
        1) RDBMS and associated JDBC driver and appropriate database
           privileges to create tables Note: This version of ActiveBPEL has
           been tested with MySQL 4.1, SQLServer 2000, DB2 8.1 and Oracle 10g
           Release 1 (10.1).

        2) aeEngine database ddl to create the necessary tables and keys

        3) Modified aeEngineConfig.xml file (discussed below)

        4) ActiveBPEL database configuration file
   
Database Setup

    To setup Tomcat and ActiveBPEL to access a database you must: 

        1) Have a database engine accessible

        2) With the Database running execute the ActiveBPEL table create ddl
           for your particular database. See your database's documentation for
           instructions on execution.
           
           All of the supported databases have a corresponding DDL file in
           [ActiveBPEL root directory]/dist/sql/activebpel.
           
Tomcat DataSource setup

    To setup a DataSource within the Tomcat environment you will need to have
    access to the Administration pages. This requires that you have added an
    "admin" role and associated a user (new or existing) with that role. To
    add a role/user to your Tomcat installation edit the tomcat-users.xml file
    located in %CATALINA_HOME%\conf directory and add the following line:
         
         <role rolename="admin"/>

    Then add a new user with the role admin or add admin to one of the default
    user supplied.
    
    To add the DataSource perform the following steps:

        1) Start/Restart Tomcat and go the Tomcat Administration page
           [http://server:port/admin/]

        2) Enter the user and password added above

        3) From the left hand frame navigate to Tomcat
           Server\Service\Host\Context (/active-bpel)\Resources\Data Sources

        4) From the Data Sources Frame select "Create New Data Source" from
           the list of Data Source Actions

        5) Fill in the appropriate Data Source information (see below for
           MySQL information)

        6) Press the "Save" and then the "Commit" buttons. 

        7) Make sure the JDBC driver .jar file is located in the
           tomcat\common\lib folder. For example, when using MySQL this is the
           "mysql-connector-java-3.0.17-production-bin.jar" file.

     Data Source Settings for MySQL:
        JNDI = jdbc/ActiveBPELDB
        Data Source URL = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/ActiveBPEL?autoReconnect=true
        JDBC Driver Class = com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
        User Name = [db user name]
        Password = [db password]
        
     Data Source Settings for DB2:
        JNDI = jdbc/ActiveBPELDB
        Data Source URL = jdbc:db2://localhost:50000/ABPEL
        JDBC Driver Class = com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver
        User Name = [db user name]
        Password = [db password]
     
     Data Source Settings for Oracle:
        JNDI = jdbc/ActiveBPELDB
        Data Source URL = jdbc:oracle:thin:@//localhost:1521/ActiveBPEL
        JDBC Driver Class = oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver
        User Name = [db user name]
        Password = [db password]
     
     Data Source Settings for SQLServer:
        JNDI = jdbc/ActiveBPELDB
        Data Source URL = jdbc:jtds:sqlserver://localhost:1433/ActiveBPEL
        JDBC Driver Class = net.sourceforge.jtds.jdbc.Driver
        User Name = [db user name]
        Password = [db password]
        
        
Engine configuration

    ActiveBPEL is installed by default with in-memory management of process
    information. To enable persistent management of process information
    replace the ActiveBPEL engine configuration file (aeEngineConfig.xml)
    located in your %CATALINA_HOME%\bpr directory with the
    aeEngineConfig-Persistent.xml file located in "[ActiveBPEL root
    directory]/dist/conf/".
    
    The aeEngineConfig.xml file must be modified to connect to your selected
    database. In order to have ActiveBPEL connect to your database modify the
    following value attribute in the aeEngineConfig.xml to correspond to your
    database.
    
        <entry name="DatabaseType" value="mysql" />
    
    Valid values are:
       - mysql
       - db2
       - sqlserver
       - oracle
    
    To revert the ActiveBPEL engine to using in-memory management copy the
    aeEngineConfig-InMemory.xml file located in "[ActiveBPEL root
    directory]/dist/conf/" to the %CATALINA_HOME%\bpr directory.
    
    Note: Any ActiveBPEL engine configuration parameters that you had set are
          now reset to the standard defaults (e.g., Allow Create XPath=false)

Restart your Tomcat installation and you will be running the ActiveBPEL engine
in a persistent manner.
